# general swim summary

start at coglans, swim back along shore. scheduling meant this swim was 100% in the dark.

# remarks

this swim was my most anxious to date. it was very difficult to see swimmers. the pod was very spread out (with only six swimmers) and it was hard to keep track of swimmers. because sean was in the back with the rear two, we had to maneuver a lot around the lead swimmers and collect/corral any that got away or went wide, meaning we were far away from the other 3 swimmers in our group. and if you got even 100 feet away from the swimmers, sometimes they'd just disappear behind very minor surface conditions.

# important/did anything go wrong

* i think i am decided that i see a swimmer that starts in freestyle switching to backstroke as a sign of distress. this mirrors my experience in tris -- when people get scared or tired they turn on their back. but they can't see where they're going. in OW, at night, this is very bad. you can't see where you're going, and because you're on your back i probably can't see your blinky.

* back on the 30hp today. i still find this motor much more difficult to manage than the 20hp. there are a couple of reasons.
  * first, the throttle on each of these motors is a little different. the "play" in the throttle when it seems to be closed means that if you're trying to manage a light throttle application, you're going to have a few degrees of twist before the throttle actually opens. since you're probably trying to move slowly, this is anxiety-inducing because you want to open the throttle a little, but it doesn't open when you think it does, so maybe you pull it a little harder, and suddenly you have too much throttle.
	* second, the 30hp kind of gets up and moves when it's all the way open. this is nice when you're chasing a boat, but it means around swimmers it honestly scares me.
	* i'm not really a person who prefers less power in a vehicle, but in this case, i really find myself less comfortable in the 30's than i am in the 20.
* i think we had a fuel line issue this morning. i can't prove this and it showed me that, despite knowing how engines work well enough, i don't know how to diagnose a dead motor on the water. i'm glad swapping the fuel line worked, but it was very nerve-wracking to be dead in the water outside the cove in the dark.
	* i'm certain i primed it before we left.
	* i'm certain the fuel breather valve was open.
	* i was pretty sure when trying to get the boat working again it was fuel, but it was frustrating to not actually know.
* we pulled a swimmer out who was done. i was very concerned about her. i had a gel with me and i think calories helped. i think the blankets also helped. but we were out on the water for probably another 30 minutes after we pulled her out, and i wanted to make sure she was okay, and i couldn't. it was good to have kristen with me, but i was preoccupied with "is our swimmer okay, and do we need to go in right now." with only two boats, you cannot do that, at all, and that is also frustrating. think in that case, if someone is injured and in danger, what you do is pull all the swimmers and go home.
* i'm still very nervous maneuvering around swimmers. in the dark it's worse. with the 30hp, it's worse.
	* there's a lot of pressure when you're piloting because it's a safety critical thing. you do not want to hurt a swimmer. if you lose swimmers, bad things happen. so i think the best way to do this is to just drill. i was thinking we could do a couple things:
		* throw a swim buoy out in the water, and just do maneuvers around it. do this maybe out in the bay so you can move around it with the current, practice holding with it, etc, in real circumstances. perhaps also doing this with a swimmer who is comfortable being safe (that is, they feel comfortable taking care of themself around a boat that is learning) rather than just the people who showed up for a swim.
		* practice docking. this is always a little tricky and if we could do it eight times, i think it would help a lot.
		* practice pulling swimmers out of the water. i know how to do this, but when i have to keep my eye on swimmers, i don't want to be distracted from those swimmers while i pull someone out. especially when my partner boat is so far away with the rear two swimmers. so, practice this.
* i think the schedule leading to this being at night was challenging for the swimmers and it's challenging for us as pilots. i love swimming in the dark and i'm very comfortable with it. but not all our swimmers are, and as a pilot it's very difficult when you can't see the swimmers. so if it's going to be dark (we need to check sunrise when we leave), i want to make sure we brief them on how to be seen, and make sure their lights are bright enough.
* i think our swim this morning was fine. and also it was very stressful. i feel like i mostly performed as well as can be expected, but my anxiety around what was going on made me less effective and i'm glad i had kristen as backup.
