# remarks
* an absolutely gorgeous swim. swimmers were unclear how to mark themselves safe afterwards to more thorough swim briefing including this is good
* telling swimmers to "pod together" and letting them know before they splash was very helpful. for the most part they self-correct and we didn't need to do a lot of directing
* the swimmers had just as much trouble sighting as we did, so it is useful to let them sight on us, which means we need to maintain ahead of them and in the right direction
* this swim would have been much more challenging if there had been more traffic in the bay or if there had been more surface chop

# important
* this went really well, but sunglasses are absolutely vital. it's tough to know if you're going to need them when you get down there because it's dark, but better to have them and not need them than need them and not have them.
* need to have a dry bag
