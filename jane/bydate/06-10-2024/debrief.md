# general swim summary

started at serc, swam to anita rock, crossed channel to little alcatraz, returned home via channel to cove. fourteen swimmers. five boats. 1:1 kayaks:swimmers. i think we had a wooden rowboat but i don't recall seeing it (they were on the radio)

# remarks

clearly some authority/communication issues between ourselves and a specific kayaker. this was resolved (i think) privately. fundamentally, people have autonomy and experience and can do whatever they like in a kayak, and escorting their buddy. on a club swim, there's an absolute, non-negotiable hierarchy of authority. vessel control > serc shore > serc pilots > serc copilots > kayaks > swimmers > harbor seals. if someone in a rhib tells you you're done and to get out of the water, you're done and you get out of the water. if someone in a rhib tells you to move your kayak or your swimmer in a certain way because of a safety reason (even without a safety reason), you do it, and that's the end of the story. this kind of event is a very specific format, and you don't have to volunteer and be part of it if you don't like rules.

in re the above, if you need to adjust a swimmer's line, and you don't have a kayak helping, and it's not easy for the swimmer to know where they're sighting (because they're crabbing in the current or maybe because the sun is in their faceâ€¦) what you can do (i learned to do this today) is you can get in front of them, and essentially place yourself in their path. i don't think there's an active "oh i need to not hit the rhib in front of me" thought (because that would be pretty annoying and i think we'd get yelled at), but the swimmer wants to avoid hitting the boat. so you obstruct them a little, causing them to deflect (and in this case, into the current, so they are pulled in the direction you want them to go, while the swimmer "thinks" theyre swimming in a straight line). this was really effective, especially absent cooperation from the kayaker who was supposed to be guiding this swimmer.

having driven the 30's a few times now, i think this was my first time driving a 20. to be honest, i kind of preferred it. it was just pieter and me, so the boat wasn't very sluggish. but the smaller motor seems to me to be a little less rowdy and easier to control. i felt completely comfortable ripping on the throttle and making full throttle, tight turns. i felt more comfortable approaching swimmers and kayaks and finer handling. i might see about doing some more swims with the 20 to see if maybe that helps me get a little more comfortable with just routine boat handling. the 20 is also more agreeable in current (holding position against current is easier). however, the transmission is really fiddly, i don't think i understand how to turn the motor off, the raise/lower lever is fiddly. i kept thinking, well thank god it doesn't have carbs and a choke, that would be even worse.

wetsuit is fine when it's brisk. i think it would turn into an actual danger if it was hotter. my watch recorded 36C, which is pretty gosh darn hot. this is atypical for us, but it's still going to happen. i need sun protection, i need water-safe clothes, and i need some kind of layers to manage the spread in temperature. the suit was absolutely soaked when i took it off, just from sweat.

# important/did anything go wrong

first part of the swim was very relaxed, and the last 40 minutes things got really tense as traffic picked up and suddenly we've got muni tugs and naval vessels.

i think we did a great job managing swimmer migration between pods, but this did happen a lot and took a lot of reorganizing boats, kayaks, and swimmers.

i think we might possibly have been able to do better estimating a swimmer's pace, but i think also that's going to change throughout the swim, and there's no accounting for feed duration or frequency. so given there are a lot of unknowables, i think the system we have is about as good as can be hoped. i'm open to hearing more about quantifying endurance swim pace (>2h).

while i do think callsigns are kind of silly (i guess i know what my gamertag is, but i feel silly calling myself that on the radio), having three kristens was very confusing. i can't yet identify everyone by voice, i still don't know everyone's name, and the radio can be a pain to comprehend because of noise and being stomped on. so "which kristen am i talking to" is.. it's not great.
