# general swim summary

started at serc, swam to anita rock, crossed channel to little alcatraz, returned home via channel to cove. fourteen swimmers. five boats. 1:1 kayaks:swimmers. i think we had a wooden rowboat but i don't recall seeing it (they were on the radio)

# remarks

clearly some authority/communication issues between ourselves and a specific kayaker. this was resolved (i think) privately. fundamentally, people have autonomy and experience and can do whatever they like in a kayak, and escorting their buddy. on a club swim, there's an absolute, non-negotiable hierarchy of authority. vessel control > serc shore > serc pilots > serc copilots > kayaks > swimmers > harbor seals. if someone in a rhib tells you you're done and to get out of the water, you're done and you get out of the water. if someone in a rhib tells you to move your kayak or your swimmer in a certain way because of a safety reason (even without a safety reason), you do it, and that's the end of the story. this kind of event is a very specific format, and you don't have to volunteer and be part of it if you don't like rules.

# important/did anything go wrong

first part of the swim was very relaxed, and the last 40 minutes things got really tense as traffic picked up and suddenly we've got muni tugs and naval vessels.

i think we did a great job managing swimmer migration between pods, but this did happen a lot and took a lot of reorganizing boats, kayaks, and swimmers.

i think we might possibly have been able to do better estimating a swimmer's pace, but i think also that's going to change throughout the swim, and there's no accounting for feed duration or frequency. so given there are a lot of unknowables, i think the system we have is about as good as can be hoped. i'm open to hearing more about quantifying endurance swim pace (>2h).
